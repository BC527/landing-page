The Odin Project CSS Project

This project is from the Odin Project and serves to practice CSS styling skills. This was my very first attempt at building a website layout template, which was given to me. 

I struggled with this for a time and have a new appreciation for how tricky web-dev, even in styling, can be. It was fairly easy to get a template that had approximately the right look and feel to what was given, but to get it "just so" would take a lot of time.
